# FLASHCARDS - REACT-NATIVE
This is a react native application which generates decks for users. The user can add as many cards as they want to each deck. These cards contain a question and an answer which the user inputs. The user may go through each flashcard and log their guesses for each one. Once they go through each card in the deck, a results page is displayed which displays the number of correct answers.

## Features
* Stack and Tab navigation.
* Create and adding new decks and cards.
* AsyncStorage for persistent storage.
* Redux store.
* Permissions and Notifications to generate Local Notifications for the user.

## Instructions
Use `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
Use `expo start` to start the `expo-cli`. Once the Expo-Developer-Tools tab has loaded in your browser, select to run the project on an Android emulator or a physical device.

## Note
* The Application has been tested to work on Android API 28 or Android 9.0.
